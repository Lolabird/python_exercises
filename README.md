# python_exercises
Hi everyone!

This repo is simply here to publicly document my journey learning Python. 

You can find the syllabus I'm following here: [Python Syllabus](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i9vuhr/i_wrote_a_syllabus_for_learning_python_and_django/). Here is an alternative link to just the syllabus: [Alt Link](https://swanky-grain-b94.notion.site/095503041d6a46ddb6986f488e578778?v=1df9edcba1ca4d34a606d95b897f6025).

I'm currently starting at the very beginning with *How to Think Like Computer Scientist* (thinkspy for short - why? Dunno. That's just what the interactive book is called on Runestone Academy. It likely means "think computer science Python".) and *CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software*

thinkcspy has a bunch of exercises at the end of each chapter that I will be uploading in its corresponding folder. ~~For now, I will just post the questions and my solutions in markdown. Currently doing exercises in sandboxes in the book so I don't know how to actually compile Python, yet.~~

I found out that it's really easy to just execute Python in the terminal. I will still put the exercises in Markdown along with their results but will now include each exercise in its own file as well. I want to get those Python points from GitHub lol.

I also won't be posting solutions to every single exercise - only the ones I found to be interesting - mainly the ones I had to think up solutions for myself. 

Anyway - that's enough rambling! If you're planning to do the course yourself, make sure you try the exercises yourself before looking at my solutions. If you're just here out of curiosity (hi!), feel free to say hello and leave feedback. 

Enjoy!
